## THE MANY WAYS TO THWART VIRUSES

~~The diagram describes the various ways medicines, targetting either host cells or the virus that ==to== interrupt the virus's invasion at different stages of the virus's lifecycle, can take effect.~~

==The diagram describes the various ways medicines interrupt the virus's invasion, by targeting either host cells or the virus at different stages of the virus's lifecycle.==

Fisrt, at the viral entry stage, blocking certain cellular receptors ~~or functional viral proteins~~ discourages the process.

After entrance, when polypeptides are translated from viral RNA, inhibitors targetting viral protease, which chops polypeptides into proteins, goes into effect.

To sabotage the ~~cell's~~ ==virus's== replication, nucleoside analogues disguised as viral RNA is incorporated into viral clones, making them malfunction. Disabling host proteins that aid this process ~~helps~~ ==is also effective==.

When the virus, covered by a layer of membrane, is being assembled, medicine can distinguish the membrane covering viral particles from host membrane by its larger curvature, selectively piercing the former to obstruct assembly, thereby stopping its release.

写到一半，感觉直接在提交页面写效率会高一点，所以放弃了。

Inaccuracies:

* Word choice:
  * “**prohibit** cell receptors”
* Collocation:
  * “**interfere** the reproduction process of virus”
    * interfere是非及物动词（牛津英汉汉英词典），不能接名词
  * “**disable** the virus **to** transport”
    * 感觉应该用“**disable** the virus **from** transporting”
* Grammar
  * “mainly by **inhibit** relevant”
    * 感觉应该用inhibiting。
